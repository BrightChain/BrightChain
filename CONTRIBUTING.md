# Contributing

This project welcomes contributions and suggestions.

Contributions must be free of proprietary intellectual property conflicts, such as violating NDAs
or accidentally contributing material that is substantially identical to IP of an employer.

Once committed, code becomes the property of the BrightChain Consortium which has yet to materialize,
but will constitute the shard-holders/board of the original/authentic BrightChain federation/quorum.
Until legal formation, Jessica Mulein is the controlling owner.

Contributions are protected by the license adopted by this project at the time of first commit.
This is presently Apache 2.0.
