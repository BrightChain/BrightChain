# BrightChain
## (pre-alpha work in progress. Limited alpha testing coming soon!) 

A Lightweight BlockChain- LightChain based on a Brightnet Blockstore- BrightChain.
All the benefits of blockchain dApps and contracts without the mining and waste.
Unlimited storage for everyone, and a mathematically reinforced and moderated community that will last for the ages.

- BrightChain Engine in C#/.Net 6 (Currently requires VS 2022 Preview, or IntelliJ Rider)

  - Note that some of the classes don't have docblocks yet, but I've gotten many. The "TODO/example" text is in place as well, but if you click into the sections the content is there.

# One-Pager
The BrightChain "One-Pager" is about 3 pages at the moment, but pending some slimming down is about as concise a document as I've put together.
