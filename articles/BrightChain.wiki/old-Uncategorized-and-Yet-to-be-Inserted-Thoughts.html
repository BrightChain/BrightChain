<pre><code>BRIXBOSTON100 — 04/29/2021
This might be a strange question, but do you see any way that Bitclout and Brightchain could intersect? Forgive, as I haven't finished going through the whole repo and the docs. I've been considering sidechain tech for a collectible game dapp for example. And a friend of mine was discussing making a more robust social network. I noticed that with brightchain you envisioned math for more complex ideas of Credibility, which is supposed to be what Clout is (by value of ones coin.)  Brightchain speaks to being open to a review system of some kind or reputation. (There is actually a chrome extension that is being worked out for star ratings of bitclout profiles but the star ratings aren't written to the blockchain I don't think.) But just wondering if you see how the two could intersect. I could definitely see the use of having other sidechain tech for Bitclout, as well as interactions with entirely new and existing chains.
JessicaMulein — 04/30/2021
That's funny. I was just talking to lazynina about that
JessicaMulein — 04/30/2021
I do think so.
I do think BitClout could intersect- but getting all the creator coin values to carry over might be odd.
it really depends on whether I want to build bright chain to intersect
but i feel that it has better and bigger potential
and that maybe some kind of exchange / equivalence could be set up, frankly thats where I need a math person
BitClout is a lot of what I wanted to write- but ultimately it's not based on the currency and block store i had in mind.
BrightChain I really intend to be energy conscious
i wanted the energy unit to be the Joule
and really try to at least have a relevance to a real Joule even if it's a conversion factor
Eg if it takes a kw to mine...
there's a really easy number there
and Proof of Work intensity can be set to keep that number low.
and ideally good actors in the network pay minimums
bad actors pay fees.
good actors are also being rewarded in low proof  of works for providing services and resources
such as storage
eg
ideally i want new people to the network when they sign up to have a checkbox to set up a bright block node that will privately store a reserved chunk of disk space. 256MB or something
by default. Small hopefully.
This would be for desktops
phones wouldn't do that.
they'd just be clients.
but when you do set up a node
you get perks back from the network
and when your blocks are pulled by the node
private nodes just talk to the core servers only
or other servers
but public nodes could serve up api of their own
be another egress
a little onion-routery
ultimately blocks can originate anywhere and percolate through the network
they're all just random junk
as long as certain block sizes with certain hashes continue to exist for as long as people request them
and replicas get spread around to ensure this
popular blocks are more highly replicated
this stuff needs to be worked out
OFF-System solved some of this, but my system departs
every block when stored is stored with a &quot;keep until&quot; value that you pay for. The longer you request, the more expensive the block
Additionally, there's a redundancy level you request
like ephemeral, higher performance, or more glacier type offering
think curent big cloud provider storage tiers
cold hot warm etc
but i think maybe you can see where the gist of the network is headed
moreover there's kind of a yelp/reputation end of this
i want it so that Alice says hey Bob, Thanks for XXXX 5-stars
and there's a URI with a transaction there.
you can rate anything with a URI- a phone number, a specific web order url
whatever.
Bob has a chance to respond
Now if Bob is a great guy and all he ever does is contribute to the network and has a good reputation
(there may be multiple reputation aspects- storage, messaging, overall?)
then bob's ratings about things maybe mean more than someone who is a turd and just never contributes anything to the network
if Mallory is said turd
Mallory then will ultimately be given higher proof of work requirements for her interactions with the network
and maybe quit
the network wins
So the network draws in new people
JessicaMulein — 04/30/2021
to rate their friends
to contribute
to respond to ratings
and when they sign up, they're encouraged to use social so we get email, phone, name, extra correlating bits
ideally everybody and every business/organization in the network has one unique identity
and they can then have aliases registered
much of this is covered in the documentation, but much of this isn't yet
I've been working to increase the documentation
clean it up, clarify
So... BitClout
It has a lot in common
but these other blockchains dont really have an underlying block store
and they don't really have a reputation or identity system like this
and so while yes if we worked together, or i made a brightchain bitclout node that just used brightchain for storage and made people auth in their bitclout accounts
that could work
i dont ultimately see that as the right path
i think brightchain is going to build its own community
but i think and hope this might be the last community
its a network
its not a website
it will have a website- the five-by-five social
bitcloutey sort of end
it may have many websites
BrightChain is as much Internet 3 as anything
i intend the underlying block system to do redis like caching and small block message passing
i see it becoming a really capable, fast filesystem, database, that in and of itself will be ideally IPv6 oriented
make use of multicasting
I see BrightChain taking over Mongo, Redis, MySql, Big Data..
I see some AI and latent semantic analysis and precomputed indexes (based on digital contracts essentially) ending the need for google and search engines to index
why index when all the blocks are already out there and you can store them semantically at the time of insert
this thing is literally a dissertation and a whole ecosystem
its not just a site like bitclout
so a bitclout like site or even bitclout itself might well fit within the scope of BrightChain.
So I think this stuff, if anybody felt like helping get all of what I just said documented in the wiki... that'd be awesome....
also, does at everyone in here only at the people in this room or the whole server
how do i talk to brightchain interested folks
how do i get this big vision and all its nuances and stuff out there
how do we make the world brighter
right now people wont want to contribute storage because if Mallory stores porn, they're transiting porn off their computers
but OFFSystem/BrightChain makes all the data meaningless.
its just alphabet soup
there's no child porn
theres a mathmatically random block of data
the recipe that you hold on to is actually the most important piece
depending how many blocks you need, you end up making multiple meta-blocks in the middle until you have a table of contents that fans out to all your total recipe blocks
i realized too that BrightChain is actually in some senses a new world government- or could turn out to be a representation of one
each shard-holder is reponsible for following its rules to decide whether to release its shard worth of FEC data
and you can pre-compute however much duplication is necessary to make sure that other shard holders can make a majority without you/based on the participating ratios, etc.
that part i think can get really complex.
Ok, I've gone on enough I imagine. Let me know if anyone decides they are passionate about this.

<pre><code>STOP THE PRESSES!
I always wanted to say that, thanks Kermit
So.. Katherine Ramdeen just threw me this and now I need to tear it down to the studs and understand Interplanetary and see if I can use it, if its a distraction or something I can actually leverage. The problem I have is BrightChain is a pretty unused tech I saw use for, and I hadn't found too many others....
